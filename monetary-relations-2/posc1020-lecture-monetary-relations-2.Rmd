# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*How do governments form international monetary regimes and when are they stable?*

### Can There Be Money Without A World Government?

Yes (clearly) but it's tricky.

- National monetary systems are a classic public good but exist only in relation to others.
- International monetary regimes normalize prices across borders.

Everyone is better off for an international monetary regime (IMR) but preferences vary.

- Absent a world government, IMRs are more informal and require voluntary cooperation.


### International Monetary Regimes as Prisoner's Dilemma

IMRs resemble a prisoner's dilemma.

- Mutual cooperation provides a Pareto improvement.
- However, cooperation requires an individual commitment that might be untenable.
- Temptations to "cheat" (i.e. devalue currency) are strong (especially in fixed-rate orders)
- If everyone does this, the IMR collapses.

# The Evolution of International Monetary Regimes
### How Do IMRs Evolve?

IMRs evolve/grow around two basic principles.

- To fix or float (or some combination of both)
- To benchmark against a commodity, paper, or commodity-backed paper.

This will provide a simple way of categorizing the three main IMRs we've observed.

## The History of Our Major IMRs
### The Gold Standard

The most famous regime fixed to gold or gold-backed currencies.

- Required priority of gold and participation in global economy (i.e. why China and Persia did not participate).
- Required close ties among states with major misgivings: Britain, France, Germany.

### The Gold Standard


Gold was stable and predictable, facilitating trade, investment, and finance. But:

- Gold standard hurt poorer, developing, and indebted countries (e.g. the U.S.).
- Curtailed ability to respond to economic crises (see: Great Depression)
- Importantly: required participation from the three major financial powers.

The gold standard as IMR was overwhelmed by major crises and wars.

### The Bretton Woods Monetary System

U.S. and British economists convened in New Hampshire to revise the gold standard.

- Organized it instead around the U.S. dollar.
- The dollar was then tied to gold at fixed rate ($35/oz).
- Other currencies were tied to the dollar with an adjustable peg.
- Also: IMF founded to monitor exchange rates.

This facilitated investment and globalization but gave governments some autonomy to adjust.

### The Bretton Woods Monetary System

The country most hamstrung by Bretton Woods was the U.S.

- The hard $35/oz commitment became untenable amid U.S. economic problems.

       caption = "Data: World Bank API. Gold reserves estimated subtracting total reserves (minus gold) from total reserves (including gold).")

```

### "Nixon Shock"

"Nixon shock" followed by executive order, which:

- dropped the link to gold and allowed the value of its currency to float.
- imposed a 90-day freeze on wages and prices.
- placed an import surcharge of 10 percent.

This was politically successful, but may have foretold a "lost decade" of stagflation for the U.S.

```



### The Present International Monetary Regime

Today: the biggest financial actors (e.g. US, Japan, Britain, Europe) float their currencies at market values.

- Concerns for volatile shifts still fall under purview of IMF.

However, concerns persist:

- Dollar standard comes with concerns for wide fluctuations in the value of the dollar.
- Smaller countries are reticent to do this and typically fix to some standard.
    - e.g. West Africa is on the franc and many South American countries peg to USD.
    
### The Euro

The euro is arguably the most conspicuous IMR today. A brief history:

- Discussion about stabilizing exchange rates starts in earnest after Nixon shock.
- Previously: pegged to Deutschmark (as largest economy in Europe).
    - However, this was a commitment some countries like France and Italy were reticent to make.
    
This led to a rather rigid/conflictual commitment for most of Europe.

- Inflation crisis post-unification magnified this.
- What followed: tit-for-tat interest rate hikes, and breaking the link to the Deutschmark.

### The Euro

Eventually: the Eurozone wanted to "Europeanize" (sic) the German standard and model.

- For Europe: allow input to monetary relations that revolved around Germany.
- For Germany: use its model as benchmark for other monetary regimes in the region.
- For both: mutual cooperation has its benefits.

## How Do Currencies Collapse?
### How Do Currencies Collapse?

Currencies collapse for familiar reasons: incredible commitments.

### How Currency Collapses Typically Happen

Currency collapses generally follow a template.

- The origins are rarely currency, per se, but some other macroeconomic downturn.
- These usually lead to calls for devaluation.
- Investors start to get shaky as government is cross-pressured.

Eventually, investors panic or the government runs out of time and the currency collapses.

### Currency Crisis as Contagion

What's unique about currency crises: they spread.

- Most currency crises of the 19th century started in the U.S.
- The tequila crisis resulted in a run on South America.
- Likewise, investors "sold" on Brazil to cover losses in Russia in 1998.

### David Rothkopf, Dep. Commerce Undersecretary (1994-95)

> This crisis [1998] was not a crisis of fundamentals. This was a crisis of confidence. In many of these places, things in a different mindset in the marketplace could have gone on okay. But what happens in a crisis of confidence is that when there is a misstep in one place, the markets start having to look for capital to cover margins and stuff like that from elsewhere.
>
> And the places that they look are where they think maybe there's going to be a problem in the future, and a lot of that's based on the confidence that has been engendered by the government's policies there. **So the Brazilians had this very unusual experience of watching Boris Yeltsin go to bed drunk and having them wake up in the morning with a hangover.**

### The 1992 ERM Crisis

![British newspapers in all their gravitas](black-wednesday.jpg)

### Some Background

Europe was reaping benefits of post-war cooperation but problems persisted.

- Europe is comprised of numerous states, some quite small.
- (West) Germany, quite large, emerged as the center of gravity in the region.
- The interest in cooperation was there but variable exchange rates complicated matters.

Europe convened and agreed on the following format:

- A European Currency Unit (ECU) as weighted average of its participating countries.
- Currency could fluctuate within a 2.25% margin (with some country exceptions).
- The Deutsche Mark emerged as the de facto anchor for the ECU.

### Problems Emerge

This crisis started in Germany, which was concerned about post-unification inflation.

- Germany responded by raising interest rates steeply.

### The 1992 ERM Crisis

This put Europe in a bind.

- Jack up interest rates: depress domestic consumption and start a recession.
- Keep interest rates level: investors flee to Germany.

### The 1992 ERM Crisis

What followed: governments left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).

- Italy devalued the lira by 7%.
- UK devalued the pound, losing around 800 million pounds in a two-week span.

Europe recovered and the crisis did not ultimately jeopardize the Euro to come.

### Containing Currency Crises

The IMF is one of the best means to detail with currency crises, but this is not easy.

- Requires cooperation from effectively the world.
- Amounts to a free-rider problem.

Correction measures routinely assume the form of austerity.

- i.e. crises that routinely start in banking/financial sector are felt by the most vulnerable in society.
    
# Conclusion
### Conclusion

IMRs are public goods, but they're not easy to devise.

- Absent a world government, cooperation is informal, effectively voluntary.
- Greater globalization of IMRs can help avoid future problems/crises.

Indeed, most of what the IMF does is disaster management, not disaster prevention.
