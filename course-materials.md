## Book

Frieden, Jeffry A, David A. Lake and Kenneth A. Schultz (2016). [*World Politics: Interests, Interactions, Institutions*](https://www.amazon.com/World-Politics-Interests-Interactions-Institutions/dp/0393938093). 3rd Edition. New York, NY: W.W. Norton and Company.

## Short Paper Instructions

10% of a student's grade for the semester will hinge on a short paper 1-2-paged *single*-spaced paper s/he will write in response to "Battle of Ideas." This was the first episode of a PBS series titled [*Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy*](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/).

The task here is fairly straightforward. The student will watch this episode, [helpfully uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlOHi2BaFu8) and embedded below. The student will write a 1-2-paged *single*-spaced paper that 1) summarizes the episode and 2) argues for three connections to the class material we had discussed to that point. The inspiration here is [Ann Handley](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Writes-Go-Creating-Ridiculously-ebook/dp/B00LMB5P0G) and her recommendation of a ["writing GPS"](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/05/everybody-writes-academic/). Therein, she argues the author of any text (in her case: web content) should be able to generate three separate answers to the question of "so what?" in order to convey the topic's importance to the reader.

This short paper is due through the Turnitin module on the course website *before* **April 13, 9 a.m**. 

[Here is the rubric](http://posc1020.svmiller.com/short-paper/short-paper-rubric.pdf) for the assignment, which also provides further instructions for the paper's frame and formatting.
