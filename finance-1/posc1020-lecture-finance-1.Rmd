# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*Overseas investment tops about $5 trillion a year. What's happening here and why is this international relations?*


### 

![Greeks in Britain urge the EU for Greek debt forgiveness](britain-greece-protest-1.jpg)

### So What Happened?

The international system is still feeling the effects of the subprime mortgage crises. Factors:

- Subprime mortgages
- Bursting of the housing bubble
- New financial products (i.e. credit-default swaps)
- Toxic assets
- Credit freezes
- Bank panics

### The Crisis in Europe

This was a disaster in the U.S. and worse in the Eurozone.

- Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain borrowed heavily from rest of Europe to finance housing boom.
- When that collapsed, those governments ran large deficits by borrowing abroad.
- However, those governments threatened default, which would've rocked all of Europe.

###

       title = "Unemployment Spiked in These Five Countries as a Result of the 2007 Financial Crisis",
       subtitle = "Unemployment is still conspicuously high in Greece and Spain.")

```
      

### The Crisis in Europe

Europe negotiated bailouts, but with austerity measures.

- Unemployment tripled in countries like Greece and Ireland.
- In Greece: GDP contracted by 20%.

This led to a lot of anti-EU establishment that still puts the continent in a precarious position.

- i.e. international finance has huge IR implications.

# Why Invest Overseas, and How?
### How and Why Do People Invest Overseas?

There are generally two types of foreign investments: portfolio and direct.

- Portfolio: simple investment with no management input.
    - Sovereign lending constitutes a big chunk of portfolio investment.
- Foreign direct investment (FDI): direct investors maintain managerial control over foreign operation.
    - Think of your BMW plant in Spartanburg, or Michelin plant in Greenville.
    
### Why Invest Abroad?

Simple: profit, and a higher rate of return.

- Countries lacking in capital will pay a higher interest for capital investments.
- Ability to invest in resources not available in home/capital-rich country.
- Certainly differences in business environment matter too.

###

```{r fdi-high-lowmid-income, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F}

WDI(country=c("XD", "XO"), indicator = "BX.KLT.DINV.CD.WD", start=1970, end=2018) %>%
  rename(fdi = "BX.KLT.DINV.CD.WD", Country = country) %>%
  mutate(fdi = fdi/1000000000000) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(year, fdi,linetype = Country, group=Country, color=Country)) + theme_steve_web() +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal("google")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2015, by =5)) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("FDI (in Trillions of Current USD)") +
  labs(caption = "Data: IMF Balance of Payments Database via World Bank API",
       title = "FDI in Developing Countries Gets Our Attention but Most FDI is Between Rich Countries",
       subtitle = "FDI everywhere took a hit after the 2007 financial crisis for obvious reasons.")

```

### The Risks of Foreign Investment

Foreign investment brings a unique risk separate from domestic investment.

- Sovereign risk: more difficult to enforce debt collection in a foreign jurisdiction.
- Foreign investors don't enjoy the same rights as national borrowers.

### Why Borrow?

Borrowing is usually quite popular within borrowing countries, at least early.

- More capital = cheaper to borrow.
- Allows for more government spending without taxation.

However, that ends when it's time to pay up.

- Governments usually service their debts through unpopular austerity measures.

### So What's the Problem?

Borrowing is contentious largely because of the **moral hazard**.

- i.e. banks view their profits as private and expect their losses to become public.

This certainly explains Wall Street's line of thinking.

## The International Monetary Fund
### The Role of the IMF

The IMF helps manage the international monetary system.

- Cooperation through an IGO to guarantee monetary stability.
- Countries contribute to fund, from which they can draw during a crisis.
- Loans are provided with low interest rates but with policy strings attached.

### Benefits of the IMF

- IMF facilitates relations between borrowers and lenders.
- Produces agreements where they might not otherwise exist.
- Helps signal creditworthiness for would-be borrowers.

### Criticisms of the IMF

IMF does disaster management, but not a lot of disaster prevention. Recent crises:

- Mexico (1982, 1988, 1994)
- East Asia (1997)
- Brazil (1998)
- Russia (1998)
- Argentina (2001)

In fact, Argentina defaulted on $93 billion of its debt and still hasn't repayed.

### Additional Criticisms of the IMF

IMF negotiations are less than "democratic."

- Routinely, ordinary citizens bear the costs of adjustment.

## The World Bank
### The World Bank

The World Bank is another BWI to facilitate international finance.

- Gets most of its money from borrowing on other financial markets, typically at low rates.
- Provides concessional lending below market rates.
- Typically "project-focused" and invested in poorer countries.

Concessional lending is less controversial than private FDI, but debt is still debt.


## Multinational Corporations
### Multinational Corporations (MNCs)

MNCs constitute one of the major institutional players in international finance. Types of FDI:

- Green field: build a new factory from the ground up (e.g. Michelin in Greenville)
- Mergers and acquisitions (e.g. Anheuser-Busch InBev)
- Joint ventures (i.e. shared ownership)

### Why Do MNCs Invest Abroad?

Again, simple: profit, and a higher rate of return.

- Minimize factor costs and search for low-labor.
- Take advantage of permissive tax environments
- Take advantage of supply chains that are simply unavailable
    - i.e. good luck getting an iPhone produced in the U.S.
    
### Problems of MNC Investment

MNCs generate profit and economic activity is good. But:

- Not a development panacea.
- Capital is more mobile than labor.
- Related problem of immigration.

Further, FDI is not well-regulated at the international level like trade is.

### A Brief Aside on Immigration

Labor is a factor of production after all...

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

International finance is an incredible opportunity, but not an unmitigated blessing.

- Foreign loans are a boon to developing countries but bring eventual harsh costs.
- FDI brings major investments but with some constraints.

A lot of good has come from increased international finance, but it's all still bargaining.
