# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*Why do states fight other countries' wars?*

# Alliances and Conflict
###  Alliances

Alliances are commitments by states to cooperate on security policy.

- They form when states have compatible interests in military cooperation. 
- Importantly, alliances can alter the bargaining dynamics in a bilateral dispute.

### Types of Alliances

- Bilateral or multilateral (e.g. NATO)
- Asymmetricalâ€”a powerful state commits to defending a weaker state (for example, the United States and South Korea)
- Offensive (e.g. Molotov-Ribbentrop)
- Defensive (e.g. France-Russia, pre-WWI)

### The Cost of Alliances

Alliances are costly. 
	
- Commitment of blood and treasure to defend another.
- Must be upheld to be credible, even if defeat is likely.
- Alliances limit freedom, as consultation with allies is necessary before taking action or making decisions. 
- An emboldened ally may entrap protector in conflict.

### Why Form Alliances?

- Weak state may gain protection from powerful rivals.
- Strong state may signal its resolve to defend weak state.
- Combining resources may economize, allowing greater defense.
- Can temper conflicts (e.g. Greece and Turkey in NATO).
- Can formalize a sphere of influence (e.g. the Warsaw Pact).

### Additional Motives

Balancing results in roughly equal blocs.
	
- Small states seek to avoid domination by alliance leader.
- Alliance with strong state threatens state freedom.

Other explanations of alliance formation

- Bandwagoning: when states join aggressive/threatening side (for example, Italy in World War II)
- Affinity: shared culture, ideology, or religion.

### How Alliances Establish Credibility

Alliance obligations are honored about 70% of the time. Reasons include:

- Hands-tying
- Abrogation costs
- Influencing decision-making calculus of opposing side in multiple ways

### When Alliances Fail

- The tail wags the dog, raising costs of war for *C*.
- Abrogation costs are cheap.

## Analyzing European Alliance System (1879-1990)
### 

![If we're talking alliances, we're talking Europe](WWI-Alliances.jpg)

### The Emergence of Germany

Germany emerged as a major power after 1870, collecting both friends and enemies.

- 1879: Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary.
    - A curious alliance, given Seven Weeks' War (1866)
- 1882: Expansion to include Italy, Austria's blood enemy.
    - Italy's rationale: placate nearby states to focus on empire.
    
### The Counter-Coalition Against Germany

This prompted quite a counter-coalition, especially among former rivals.

- 1894: Franco-Russian Alliance
- 1904: Entente Cordiale (UK-France)
- 1907: Anglo-Russian Convention

### Leading to World War I

The alliance pattern contributed to the outbreak of World War I:

- Small conflicts escalated.
- Alliances created incentives for preventive war.
- Major powers became dependent on allies.
- The larger number of states increased chances of miscalculation.

### The Interwar Period

The interwar period posed similar problems.

- Major buck-passing, definitely among UK, France, and Russia/USSR.
- Hitler successfully defied French commitments to Czechoslovakia and Romania, among others.

### The Interwar Period

We can understand why the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact happened in this perspective.

- No country was more consistent in raising alarms about Hitler than the USSR.
- However, UK and France had folded on the Ruhr, Sudetenland, and other issues.
- Thus, the Soviets bailed to placate Germany and leave UK and France to dry.

WWII happened as a result of weak alliance commitments.

### The Cold War

Clear bifurcation of Europe into West and East.

- West: NATO countries
- East: Warsaw Pact

### The Cold War

A long, if very problematic, "peace" followed.

- U.S. tied its hands to Europe with troops in W. Germany/elsewhere.
- Both sunk costs into reorganizing entire economic systems in the sphere.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Alliances are institutions that can prevent or facilitate war.

- Peaceful: influence bargaining by *B*, settle issues among signatories.
- Dangerous: tail-wags-the-dog, cheap commitments with small abrogation costs.
