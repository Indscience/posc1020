# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*Civil war happens when a government and domestic non-state actor fail to peacefully bargain over differences. What explains when that happens?*

# Civil Wars
## A Typology of Civil War
### Why Study Civil War?

- Theoretical tools apply from international to domestic context.
- Civil wars rarely stay domestic.
    - Other countries intervene/take sides
    - Spillover effects
    
### Why Rebel?

A quick typology:

- Greed vs. grievance
- Control of central government vs. secession
    - Separatist: non-state actor seeks to secede/form own country (e.g. Eritrea, South Sudan)
    - Irredentist: non-state actor seeks to secede/join another country (e.g. Donbass, Srpska)

## The Correlates of Civil War Onset
### When Dissatisfaction Leads to Armed Opposition

- Group-level explanation
- Country-level explanation 
- International factors

### Group-level Explanations

Groups better organize for rebellion when they can coordinate. What helps toward that end: 

- Groups share ethnic, religious, or linguistic affinity (e.g. Sunni insurgency).
- Have access to resources to garner support (e.g. FARC).
- Share a sense of injustice directed at government.

### Country-level Factors

There are several important country correlates for civil war.

- Poverty
- Non-democracy
    - Importantly, there may be more violence "in the middle."
- Rugged terrain
- Bigger population


### International Factors

- Foreign states may arm or aid rebels they support (see: Serbia)
- Sanctions against target government may embolden rebels (e.g. U.S. v. Nicaragua)

One wrinkle: international rivalries over territory may reduce likelihood of civil war onset.

## Civil War as Bargaining Failure

### Not All Disagreements Militarize

Not all conflicts between dissatisfied groups and the government result in civil war.

- Compare Tunisia (2011) with Syria (2011-present).

We can instead understand civil war onset as bargaining failure.

### Civil War as Bargaining Failure

We study civil war in IR because the bargaining framework applies well.

- Incomplete information
- Commitment problems
- Issue Indivisibility

### Civil War from Incomplete Information

Governments have a particular disadvantage gauging would-be rebels:

- Less scope for communication during bargaining phase
- Tough to gauge rebel capacity

### Civil War from Incomplete Information


However, the protracted nature of civil conflicts don't fit well with arguments of incomplete information.

- That said, nature of civil war (i.e. insurgency, asymmetric warfare) magnify the information problem for central governments.

```

### Civil War from Commitment Problem

- Very real incentives for preventative war
- Problems of post-war reconciliation
- Rebels cannot credibly promise compliance from radicals.

From this perspective, it's unsurprising that only about 25% of all civil wars end in a negotiated peace.

- Lasting peaces tend to follow outright victory.

### Civil War from Issue Indivisibility

Demands also suffer from the 0/1 problem of issue indivisbility.

- Territorial concession creates major reputation problems in multiethnic states.
- Consociationalism/power-sharing only partially mollifies concerns over control of central government.
    - Even these have commitment problems (e.g. Lebanon).

# Conclusion: What Can We Do?
### Conclusion: What Can We Do?

If peace prevails through conquest, governments need counterinsurgency strategies.

- Conventional military forces are not always very effective against insurgencies. 
- Often, conventional armies inflict collateral damage by killing women, children, and noncombatants.
    - This creates future rebels.
    
### Conclusion: What Can We Do?

    
Any lasting peace needs to win over "hearts and minds."

- Must build goodwill among population that previously rebeled.
- Need to integrate previous rebels into society/state.
- Economic development and democracy are almost musts.
    - But therein lies a major part of the problem.
