# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*We've learned a lot of international politics' present and past, but what does the future hold?*


# The Future of International Politics
### The Future of International Politics

1. The proliferation of WMDs
2. The future of American global leadership (i.e. "The Rise of China?")
3. Globalization and its discontents

### So is North Korea a Nuclear Country?

![Kim celebrates](kim-jong-un.JPG)

Yes, and we are *way* past that part of the puzzle.

### So What Is At Stake With North Korea?

There are a few things still on the table:

1. Delivery/guidance
2. Payload
3. Second-strike
4. Acceptance/legitimacy

These are more about scope and repercussions. North Korea is already a nuclear-armed country.

### Is Non-Proliferation Even a ''Bad Thing?''

There is a strand of scholarship that argues for proliferation.

- i.e. "mutually assured destruction"
- "The Long Peace"

### How Would Mutual Deterrence Work?

1. Guaranteed second-strike
2. Leaders must be rational/strategic (i.e. value survival)
3. Identification of first-strike initiator

### Why Should We Be Skeptical of Nuclear Deterrence?

- "Small *n*" and conspicuous cases
- Rivals like India and Pakistan may be only a bit more cautious, and still as conflict-prone.
- Nuclear weapons still alter distribution of power.
- Nuclear countries may not meet some of the previous assumptions (see: Pakistan)
- Proliferation into non-state actors

### How Can We Prevent Nuclear Proliferation?

Same way you discourage anyone from doing anything:

1. "Carrots and sticks"
2. Prevention of access to raw materials

### Providing Assurances

So many nuclear weapons programs follow direct fears from rivals.

- The U.S. developed theirs in response to Nazi Germany's efforts.
- The Soviets developed theirs in response to the Americans.
- Likewise: UK and France vis-a-vis the Soviets.
- Sino-Soviet split = nuclear weapons in China
- India in response to China
- Pakistan in response to India
- DPRK in response to the U.S.

### Providing Assurances

Guaranteed security interests can dissuade states from developing their own arsenals.

- The Soviets dissuaded Syria from a nuclear program.
- The U.S. has blocked nuclear programs in Germany, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

However, *these assurances must be credible and indefinite*.

- So much of the current problem in North Korea is a function of broken assurances to Libya.

### Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an important milestone in non-proliferation.

- Signals strong interest from all nuclear powers, with some credible punishments.

However, the empirical record is mixed.

- NPT can't fundamentally alter state interests (e.g. India, DPRK).
- Still recognizes rights to a civilian nuclear program, which compounds commitment problem (e.g. Iran)

### Coercive Disarmament

One final option: threat and use of military force. However, this is fraught with problems:

1. Commitment problems (see: Libya)
2. Not a good option when nuclear weapons aren't the focal point of the problem (see: Iran, DPRK)
3. Most nuclear development is *sub rosa* after the Osirak reactor bombing.

```

### What's the Problem With China's Rise?

"Rising" states expect to do better in war.

- As a result, it's more likely to threaten force to revise the status quo.
- A "risen" China is less likely to honor the terms of a pre-power transition agreement.

Indeed, commitment problems magnify the war-proneness of power transitions.

- Further, the U.S. and China have more disagreements than previous cases like Germany and Japan after WWII.

### Is There Cause for Optimism?

Optmistic analysts see promise in China's globalization/leadership efforts.

- e.g. participation in WTO, Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank

Indeed, China seems to have a vested stake in the current economic/political order, disputes with the U.S. notwithstanding.

- However, Chinese behavior still permits major skepticism.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- WMDs have become easier and cheaper to produce, and more countries are producing them.
    - Solutions require altering the incentives of would-be proliferators, through both carrots and sticks.
- China's "rise" may lead to war with the U.S.
    - Preventing this requires integrating China into U.S.-created institutions.
- Globalization is a force for peace, but it's a policy that creates winners and losers.
    - How you compensate the losers will condition the future of globalization.
